## Introduction

> Chopsticks is a hand game for two or more players, in which players extend a number of fingers from each hand and transfer those scores by taking turns to tap one hand against another. Chopsticks is an example of a combinatorial game, and is solved in the sense that with perfect play, an optimal strategy from any point is known.

For our project, we digitalize this hand game and initiated some reworking and remodeling of the whole design process. We utilize the variant with remainders and transfers, with an additional extension of including boolean operations into the game (instead of just additions and modulos).

Use the `BrPinTest` project inside the `tests` folder to test the operability of each SingleEndedIO pin of the custom Alchitry Br board.



## Future Work

- Scoring system using persistent data
- Audio/sound/music player using a speaker/buzzer
